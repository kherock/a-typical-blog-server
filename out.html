                <p>Want to know why it's important to have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015/06/01/us-patriot-act-vote-fails/">checks on mass surveillance</a> programs? Colombia should serve as a good example. <em>Privacy International</em> <a href="https://privacyinternational.org/node/635">reports</a> that the country not only collects bulk internet and phone data on a grand scale, but violates the law in the process -- it's supposed to require judicial approval for <em>any</em> surveillance, but regularly ignores that oversight. Colombian agencies have also relied on controversial tools like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014/08/12/fcc-imsi-stingray/">IMSI catchers</a> (which scoop up nearby cellphone data) and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015/07/09/how-spyware-peddler-hacking-team-was-publicly-dismantled/">Hacking Team's</a> spyware, and they've sought to expand their powers rather than rein things in.</p>

                    <p>It's no secret that Colombia has a history of surveillance, fueled in no small part by its decades-long battles with rebels and drug cartels. And unfortunately, the pressure to keep an eye on communications isn't likely to drop anytime soon. A <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/28/world/americas/colombians-flee-venezuelas-crackdown-on-immigrants.html?_r=3&amp;gwh=452C3A6E933A577CDD30E6DDC047AA3F&amp;gwt=pay">Venezuelan immigrant crackdown</a> has forced many Colombia-born residents back to their homeland, increasing tensions between the two countries. It may take a long while before the political climate is truly conducive to surveillance reform.</p>
